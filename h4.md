### The following refers to Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

* Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter, and forms the basis and rationale for the development and usage of "an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust", instead of the usual model where financial institutes form a trusted third party that handles electronic transactions. 
* One key aspect mentioned is the reversibility of transactions and the inherent fraud in a system where transactions are reversible and based on trust in the current system, and how a system based on cryptographic proof without reliance on trust would reduce the kind of fraud that is inherent in a trust-based system.
* Chapter 2 defines what a transaction is in the described system. Effectively a coin is a chain of digital signatures, where the previous owner signs a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner of the coin. The chain of ownership can then be verified by anyone.
* This, however, introduces a double-spending problem, where the owner of the coin could create multiple transactions to different recipients for the same coin, which the recipient would not be able to check. Since there is no central authority to determine whether double spending occurred, this would go unnoticed if one was only aware of transactions addressed to oneself.
* The solution outlined in chapter 2 is to instead have a public history of all transactions and that the majority of participants in the system agree on which payments are valid.
* The short chapter 3 just includes the concept of a timestamp server, which takes the hash of a block of items with the timestamp, which proves that those items existed at the time of the timestamp and includes a usenet example
* Chapter 4 describes a proof-of-work system to implement the timestamp server in chapter 3. Essentially the process described is to calculate hashes of the block with a random nonce appended until one with a certain number of zero bits in the beginning is found. Once such a block has been found, it can be easily verified by the rest of the network by calculating just one hash.
* Proof-of-work also solves the problem of representation by having it be determined by CPU power instead of, for example, IP addresses, where those having control over IP address allocation could subvert the majority. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by "honest" nodes, the honest chain will find valid blocks the quickest and so outpace any other.
* The chapter also mentions a difficulty factor based on a moving average of a certain number of blocks per hour to account for increasing CPU power.
* Chapter 5 puts all of the above together into a series of steps, listed below verbatim:
  1. New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
  2. Each node collects new transactions into a block.
  3. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
  4. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
  5. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
  6. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
* As nodes work on the longest branch, in case of multiple valid blocks being found approximately simultaneously, nodes will pick one and eventually move on the whichever branch ends up advancing faster.
* New transactions also do not need to reach all nodes at the same time, as eventually they will be included in a block as long as they reach sufficiently many.
* Chapter 6 deals with the incentives of the network. In every valid block the first transaction is a special one that is owned by the creator of the block. This adds new coins into the network without a central authority to disburse them, and also provides an incentive to reward nodes performing proof-of-work calculations.
* An additional incentive exists in the form of transaction fees. Once the predetermined amount of coins has entered circulation, the incentive can be purely based on transaction fees, which the chapter mentions is inflation-free.
* Lastly the chapter mentions that the incentive system also makes it more likely that a greedy attacker finds acting within the network's rules more profitable than attempting to undermine it and thus also undermine the validity of their own coins

Commentary:

It has been a while since I read the paper, and the incentive structure especially is fascinating. There is effectively no monetary benefit in attacking the network directly, since if you manage to undermine the trust in it, the value of all coins would quickly drop to zero. It must be mentioned, however, that the potential fraud scenarios involved with a centralized source of trust ("traditional banking") also allow reversing fraud, where in this kind of network reversing fraud is not possible. If you mess up, then that mess-up is final and there is no central authority to turn to beyond law enforcement. Identifying the owner of a wallet (public key) can, however, be impossible or take a long time. As all kinds of social engineering is common, this opens up different avenues for fraud.

Even so, I prefer the freedom of a system where you are responsible for your own mistakes, and a centralized authority is unable to discriminate based on any personal qualities. Even in western countries there are recent examples of banks refusing service to political dissidents simply based on ideological differences, as well as governments pressuring or forcing banking institutions to perform the same without any actual breaking of the law.

One important aspect is also the deflationary nature of the described network. As the amount of coins is finite, eventually the currency will be completely deflationary, which means that there is no urgency to spend it to avoid inflationary value loss, but rather keep it as a store of value. The problem with deflationary currencies always boils down (simplistically) to "why would I spend it now, since it will be worth more tomorrow?". It will be interesting to see how far Bitcoin will go, as a deflationary currency would probably result in only necessary spending, similar to how one does not want to liquidate well-growing stocks without a reason.

Tried sending the money, Electrum doesn't want to cooperate, also tried changing the testnet server, but still claims not enough funds

Managed to figure out it in the end, the transaction fee was set too high as 0.1 mBTC is not a lot and the slider was not going low enough, so created it manually:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc780ce-5f60-4fa4-b09e-3f039db7c3f1)

In this case the change address is also an address in my wallet, the reason is because all of the BTC from a previous transaction must be sent as outputs, so if there is too much you need to specify that they be sent back to yourself or they will go to fees. After that pressed Sign and Broadcast, but the network seems to be very picky and ends the connections very fast, but this is the end result:

## e) Note: this answer was amended 2 hours after deadline

I chose bitcoin block 852427 to analyze, as it is one of the blocks the MtGox bankruptcy trustee used to distribute civil rehabilation coins to a crypto exchange that had an agreement to further distribute them to creditors. In this case the cryptocurrency exchange was Kraken, as outlined in, for example, https://www.theblock.co/post/305608/mt-gox-creditors-say-kraken-received-bitcoin-from-trustee-payouts-anticipated-in-7-14-days. The following is a screenshot from https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/852427?page=1&sort=value&order=desc

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff79ad20-7ec9-4ac0-bfa7-129be46842b7)

The initial hash, 0000000000000000000213bc18d7e852578fa68d53896635a2416577febb612a, is the hash that whoever mined the block ended up with. In total the block transferred almost $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin at the time the block was mined (at the time of writing as can be seen in the screenshot bitcoin value has gone up almost 50% from that time). Depth means the blockchain depth at the time of taking the screenshot, meaning a further 18794 blocks have since been mined (this is also known as confirmations in some clients). Effectively if one wanted to tamper with the block in some way one would have to mine almost 18800 blocks while the current chain mines none to achieve the longest chain, which is effectively impossible. When transferring bitcoin to exchanges, for example, the exchange may have a requirement like "5 confirmations" before the funds are actually available for you to use. This means that a further 5 blocks need to be mined after the transaction block, to effectively "lock" in the chain where the transaction originated. Since a bitcoin block takes on average 10 minutes to mine, such a requirement would mean a delay of 50 minutes before you could use the transaction bitcoin on the exchange. This requirement varies by chain and by exchange.

Nonce is the random sequence of bits that alongside the other data in the block were used to arrive at the valid hash. Difficulty relates to how many initial zero bits are required, and it adjusts dynamically based on the hash rate of the network. Minted value reflects the inherent incentive price, although the precise value is 3.125 BTC, since the value halves every certain number of mined blocks (initially 50, then 25, then 12.5, then 6.25, now 3.125). Reward is the total of minted value and rewards associated with the transactions in the block.

There were 5089 transactions within the block, which consisted of 7441 inputs and 11139 outputs. A transaction can consist of many inputs and outputs, let's take the MtGox transaction as an example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af500f2a-b0dc-4b07-8da5-c49d86bae531)

The total transaction consisted of three different source wallet addresses, and the transaction was sent to two destination wallet addresses. Interestingly, whenever one sends bitcoin to an address, the entire value of the previous transaction is sent, and if there is too much the remainder is sent back to yourself (either the same wallet address or a different one you control). Take the transaction below that, as an example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e392856-3dc2-4794-bca0-c18dcc4acbe3)

In this instance you can see that about 17674 BTC was sent and split to two destination addresses, 8.99 to one and 17665 to the other. If you look closely, however, you can see that the larger destination amount is sent to the same wallet where the transaction originated from. Effectively this transaction was just a transaction of 8.99 bitcoin to address bc1q0szdgnjn30msnq3852njc8sse357uw7qxxxj4p, even though it looks larger, as the remainder were sent to the originating address. If any is left over beyond the outputs, that is the transaction fee associated with the transaction. This method is called UTXO, Unspent Transaction Output model, and is explained more in depth at, for example, https://river.com/learn/bitcoins-utxo-model/. If the person wanted to further spend the 17665 leftover coins for a 1 BTC transaction, the transaction would have to include that as the input and 1 BTC as the output for the target and 17664 BTC as another output to his own public address (the same or a new one).

This can be further demonstrated in the following transaction:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6cf51a8-6b44-46ed-bfce-157ac75ab1b5)

As you can see, in the input side there are three inputs from the same address. This is because those are the previous "UTXOs", so even though those three inputs contain approximately 71 BTC, they could not be used as just one input since they came from different transactions.

The blocks can also contain messages, and in the case of this block there is the following:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18a5c510-333c-49ce-81c1-2ead0b91486f)

As most mining in the bitcoin network is done by mining pools, they seem to like appending messages in case they solve the block. It is effectively a small advertisement.

There are a lot of other things to comment on, but those are the most important parts regarding blocks and transactions.

## f)

* Argument 1: Cryptocurrency compared to traditional money is easier to lose, more volatile, bad for the environment and can't be easily used as a medium of exchange (00:00 - 00:27)
  * There is some truth to those points, but it is mostly hyperbole. The first three points have their own sections later, but the point about cryptocurrency not being able to be used as a medium of exchange is perhaps a more valid one, but it depends on the cryptocurrency in question. Some networks confirm transactions within seconds, which would make them suitable for even everyday transactions, but there just isn't the same kind of infrastructure for direct crypto transactions as credit cards, for example. Many crypto exchanges provide their own versions of debit cards (Visa/Visa Electron) that you can use to directly use your cryptocurrency balance to pay a bill. The transaction is still ultimately made in traditional currency, but such bridges make utilizing cryptocurrency simpler.

* Argument 2: Cryptocurrency is used and valued among pedophiles (00:27 - 00:36)
  * True, but so is traditional money. Bad actors naturally gravitate to funding methods that are more anonymous, but good actors also rely on anonymity of funding, such as political dissidents. Wikileaks is one example of this.

* Argument 3: The terminology for cryptocurrency can be used to dazzle less-informed people to scam them out of their money (0:45 - 1:13) (2:00 - 2:29)
  * Scams always exist wherever there is money involved, and cryptocurrencies are not alone in this. Beyond just scams, salespeople are also adept at generating interest using fancy terms and tying them with the current zeitgeist, as evidenced by the legendary bullshit generator (https://www.bullshitgenerator.com/). This is just a new application for dazzling with bullshit, not something unique to cryptocurrencies.

* Argument 4: Cryptocurrency performs useless calculations and wastes energy (1:19 - 1:30)
  * All infrastructure uses energy to function, and perhaps for proof-of-work it is somewhat wasteful, but there are more modern protocols that utilize proof-of-stake, for example. I also consider the energy use only wasteful if there is no useful application behind it, which there in my view is, so it is exaggerated. The energy use also self-regulates based on supply and demand (more energy cost, fewer miners, less energy cost, more miners etc). I also believe that policies that drive any kind of energy scarcity are bad for humanity, so in this case the problem is not that proof-of-work uses a lot of energy, but rather that modern energy policy is so political that energy is scarce. Just mass-build nuclear power and there are no energy problems.

* Argument 5: The value of cryptocurrency is independent of governments (1:30 - 2:00)
  * This is technically true, but since the value is often based on speculation, governmental regulation can have significant effects on the value of specific cryptocurrency. The biggest regulatory hurdles have, in my view, already been beaten, and so government regulation at least in the short term is less of a threat than 5-10 years ago. One might say that cryptocurrency (as a concept, not any individual coin) has become too big to fail.

* Argument 6: It is easy to lose the private keys to a wallet (2:29 - 3:00)
  * This is one of the key problems with cryptocurrency, as the safety is completely dependent on the (often at least somewhat ignorant) ability of the wallet holder. With a centralized authority if you lose a credit card or someone steals it, you have options, but with cryptocurrency there are none. Using big crypto exchanges as custodial wallets can eliminate the private key problem, but then you rely on the exchange not to fail and take your crypto with them.

* Argument 7: Cryptocurrency can be used to buy drugs and pornography (3:05 - 3:10)
  * So can traditional money, and while targeting the transactions of bad actors is an effective way to catch them, they are not the only way. I generally do not advocate throwing any babies away with the bathwater, but this is a common argument for any reduction of freedom in the name of safety/security ("think of them childrens")

* Argument 8: Investing in cryptocurrency is risky due to its volatility (3:10 - 4:00) (5:00 - 6:00)
  * This is true, but it also makes it lucrative. One must simply always invest in cryptocurrency with the mindset that at any point everything (or most) could be lost. Nowadays the larger cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin/Ethereum) are actually quite coupled with the traditional stock market due to big players also investing in crypto, so the volatility follows traditional stock markets, just with somewhat more volatility (stock market goes +5%, crypto might do +10% etc). The smaller the cryptocurrency, the more volatile it naturally is.

* Argument 9: Nice reference to pyramid schemes via the logo (3:59 - 4:02)
  * A lot of the smaller cryptocurrencies (memecoins or shitcoins) have constant rugpull attempts, and a pyramid scheme is one form of that. My favourite one is the rugpull, where a person creates a token using a smart contract, then hypes it up as the next coming of something, and when greedy gamblers buy it to attempt to be the first adopters and pull in some innocent people as well, all or most of it gets sold by the creator, the price tanks, and the rug has been pulled. A few people win, most involved with it lose. From what I see most of these are in the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars worth at most.

* Argument 10: NFTs are nothing but a bunch of ephemeral bits (4:03 - 4:27)
  * This is true, but there is a philosophical argument about having the ability to own an original of anything. Take Mona Lisa, for example, why does the original have any additional value compared to a near perfect copy? This is also why NFTs represented pictures, as they were branded as "digital art" and later on "procedurally generated digital art", as a picture is too big to store on a blockchain, but the seed to a procedural algorithm is not, so technically the picture actually lives on the blockchain but just in a compressed form.

* Argument 11: GPU mining causes high demand and price for gamers (4:29 - 5:08)
  * This was very true for a few years if I recall correctly, as GPU prices years ago got very inflated because of the hype around GPU mining. Nowadays GPU mining has been replaced with ASICs, which are even more specialized to mine efficiently, so cryptocurrency mining impact on the GPU and gaming market is, in my view, minimal.
