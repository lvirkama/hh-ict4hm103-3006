### Chosen review article: Botta, A., & Ratbeim S., & Zinno, S., & Vnetre, G. Cyber security of robots: A comprehensive survey, Intelligent Systems with Applications, Volume 18, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iswa.2023.200237

* The publisher has a Jufo rating of 1 (https://jfp.csc.fi/jufoportaali?Jufo_ID=91159)
* The review article looks at the cybersecurity of robots and included 78 studies after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied.
* In figure 1 the review article presents an overview of the identified cybersecurity issues of robots (the following image is included verbatim from the article):

* The article found that accidents make a small minority of the identified issues, and the majority are attacks.
* The identified issues are separated to three different areas: physical, networking and software/OS
* They found that it is difficult to have a generalized security model for physical threats, because of the high variance in physical components and design, and suggest that the awareness of different physical attack profiles could be helpful in mitigation.
* For network attacks, the following was found:
  * Sensors are the most sensitive and important component that can be easily exploited with network cyber attacks.
  * Attacks on sensors include false data injection, scaling and stealthy attacks.
  * NFC and Wi-Fi allow for other types of attacks, such as Denial of service, Man in the middle, eavesdropping and data spoofing.
  * Several humanoid robots were found to have poor cybersecurity and vulnerabilities in authorization and DoS resilience
* Software or OS was found to be the most vulnerable component out of the three areas, and made up 92,6% of threats in the robot vulnerability database. Networking is the second most important.
* The review mentions several OS penetration testing tools, which include ROSPenTo, ROSchaos and ROSploit
* The researchers suggested the following techniques to protect robots:
  * Physical
    * Early detection. The robots may inhibit physical signs such as robot halting or delay in responding to commands.
    * Include a trusted execution environment in the hardware
  * Networking
    * Anomaly and intrusion detection can use machine learning, statistical methods and pattern recognition to identify attacks
    * Some easy to detect attacks are: jamming, tampering, sinkhole attack, DoS, Sybil attack, wormholes, spoofing, selective forwarding, eavesdropping
    * Power-based Intrusion Detection System can also be used to identify anomalous behavior through unusual power usage
    * Another major detection technique is analyzing historical data and comparing it to the expected output
  * Operating system
    * Many robots equipped with Linux have a variety of vulnerabilities.
    * The tools and frameworks that can be used to increase security are ROSRV (a runtime verification framework), ROS-Defender (a combination of event management, IDS and a firewall), ROS-Immunity (a collection of tools for internal defence, external verification and automated vulnerability detection) and ROS-FM (network monitoring framework)
    * Communication should be secured with Transport Layer Security and encrypted.
* The various effects of attacks on robots include modified performance (manipulation), damage to the components (physical damage), false instructions (spoofing), severing the command and control channel of the operator (wireless jamming), forwarding data to an attacker (stealing information) and data injection.
* The study makes security suggestions for various types of robots based on their functionality and purpose.
  * The targets for industrial, medical, small mobile and humanoid robots and drones are similar, though with different weights (Encryption, Authentication/Authorization, Network, OS and data)
  * Autonomous robots are listed as having only data and robot controllers as the targets
* The authors conclude that authentication, authorization, encryption and physical protection methods should be improved. AI and Machine learning as well as Cloud Robotics are also paradigns to investigate for inclusion to robotics.


In my opinion the review article ended up not being that interesting, since most of the threats also apply to normal information security and are thus not new. A new thing were sensors and attacks that could target them, and it was also interesting to see that robots have their own testing frameworks. The Helsec presentation dealing with consumer system testing also touched on some of the same points, such as the difficulty to automate testing of physical components due to their variability. Power-based intrusion detection was also an interesting concept (look at anomalous power usage to detect infiltration)
