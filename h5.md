### Jos Helmich - Industrial Cyber Security

* Speaker is a member of the ENISA advisory board, among other things, and got into programming and cybersecurity through Hero's Quest.
* There was a short primer on what EU acts/regulations are versus directives, an act is a union-wide law that needs to be followed, while directives direct member countries to implement the requirements in their national legislation.
* The talk was about what kind of industrial directives there are within the EU. At least NIS-2, CRA (Cyber Resilience Act), GDPR and Artificial Intelligence Act were mentioned
* NIS-2 impact centers on increased supervision by authorities, it emphasizes risk management in your own organization as well as within the supply chain and adds reporting and registration requirements. Most of the other requirements are basically ISO27001.
* Operational technology (OT) security priorities are reversed from the usual CIA acronym, where Availability is most important, then Integrity and then Confidentiality (AIC instead of CIA).
* The speaker made a distinction about office and industrial cloud/network (office and industrial space), and also referred to office space as so-called Dilbert space.
* Industrial network should optimally not be connected directly to the Internet, but rather just to the office network through a DMZ zone, with one-way traffic if possible. For cloud purposes, however, it may be necessary to connect the industrial zone (or DMZ) directly to the cloud.
* The speaker made short comments about the basic idea behind the various directives
  * NIS-2 = "Keep your house in order and don't buy BS", ask your suppliers questions about their cybersecurity and whether it's in order
  * CRA = "Don't mess up someone else and don't sell bad stuff to others"
* ISA/IEC 62443 family provides good advice on industrial cybersecurity.
* Artificial Intelligence Act is a new legislative framework for AI dealing with product safety requirements, and includes references to the GDPR, and the Cyber Resilience Act
* The risk analysis within the AIA does not just deal with physical risks, but also fundamental freedoms
  * Unacceptable risk - High risk - Specific transparency obligations - minimal risk
  * Unacceptable risk includes things like social scoring, and is completely banned
  * High risk can deal with things like recruitment and medical information, where personal information is used with AI
  * Specific transparency obligations can be things like always disclosing in case someone is being impersonated
  * If no personal information is involved with AI, classified as minimal risk.
* There was also a question about how AI oversight will work with AIA since it is an Act. The speaker acknowledged it is still unclear, since technically ENISA should be responsible for oversight of an Act, but as it may result in resource problems it may also be delegated in some form to member states. 

The talk was interesting, and especially the segmentation of the industrial network from the office network through a DMZ was a new insight for me, since I haven't really dealt with industrial networking. Usually the DMZ in my line of work is between the internal network and the Internet for Internet-facing servers, and while the internal network is usually segmented with firewalls even between internal networks, there hasn't been a real DMZ between two internal networks in any of the networks I have dealt with.
There was one point about having sequential firewalls from multiple different suppliers to make it less likely that an attacker exploiting a vulnerability can get through both at once. This has also been considered and in some cases implemented in my previous organization, sometimes even outside firewalls at the OS level (a mix of Linux and Windows for some remote access implementations, for example).
The explanation of various standards was insightful, NIS-2 I had already studied but CRA was new to me.
The different priorities within the CIA acronym were also interesting, but it makes logical sense, since if one is running industrial machinery, the most critical thing is that they keep running (Availability). Logically it also makes sense that there isn't that much truly confidential information within those systems, as they are just operating systems driving the machinery or something similar. Within the office network, on the other hand, it is far more important that information stays confidential rather than that it is available.

### Heikki ”zokol” Juva - State of Union

* The talk dealt with the cybersecurity of consumer devices and how they relate to various current and upcoming EU regulations and building a framework for testing compliance.
* The two specific regulations were the Cyber Resilience Act (dealing with technical security and vulnerability handling) and the Radio Equipment Directive (dealing with network security, personal information, financial misuse)
* RED enforcement starts in 8/2025, CRA vulnerability notification in 2026 and enforcement in 2027.
* According to the speaker RED and CRA overlap, so when CRA becomes active RED will become less meaningful.
* The regulations have some good and problematic requirements
  * Good: Vulnerability coordination, input checking, crypto standards, password handling, content filtering only from trusted sources
  * Problematic: Less security can be accepted if justified by compatibility reasons, the device can depend on external security and does not need to be standalone-secure, and evaluation is paper-based, not device-based (no testing is required, just paper affirmation that everything is ok) 
* To test consumer device compliance, the questions that the speaker asked were "how do consumer devices communicate, where and why" and tested the 10 most popular consumer devices by buying them anonymously from a retailer and testing them in blackbox fashion (no extraneous background knowledge beyond the device itself).
* The speaker went through the requirements in the RED through a testing case (case "Eagle"), which was an IP camera and a smart sock
  * Good: The device had updates enforced, all sensors that may affect user's privacy were documented
  * Bad: Device storage was not secure and the default passwords were weak, so the device was vulnerable
  * Worse: Boilerplate privacy policy, so user is not notified of changes, data gets sent to USA so GDPR is claimed to not apply (questionable), and the device wipe did not actually wipe everything like the previous Wi-Fi and network details.
* Overall, however, when evaluating the top 10 bestselling devices from the healthcare category, the following things were found:
  * Networking was fine in 90% of the cases, ciphers and encryption were fine and cert pinning was used.
  * Common issues included data not being removed, information being shared with 3rd parties and the seller not having full details on the devices due to complex manufacturing.
* There was a demonstration on how for one device the firmware provided enough information to find the company, their contact information, head of R&D and their public R&D budget.
* The speaker also lamented how a lot of devices are so-called bare-metal devices, which makes automated testing impossible since there are no generic tools for that. For the devices that utilize some form of Linux, for example, automated testing is practical.

The demonstration on looking at vulnerabilities was very interesting, since I know some theory, but have never had a need to get into a consumer device or evaluate its security like that.
I was kind of expecting that the results would be as the speaker reported, since there are a lot of ready-made libraries for crypto and networking, so I believe it takes a minimal effort to do them properly.
Data wiping, however, is often a manual operation (specify which locations on the filesystem to wipe to leave the OS intact etc), so it is not surprising that it was found lacking. This is also one reason why I tend to hoard old electronics instead of throwing them away immediately, and only after a certain time has passed so that any potential data they have remaining is stale do I throw them away.
The discussion about not being able to automatically test bare-metal devices and trying to develop some kind of testing standards like was demonstrated in the talk was also thought-provoking. It is hard to make automated tests for something that can be implemented in almost any way using any of a number of different electronics.
Overall this was perhaps the most interesting presentation of the three.

### Joona "Rinorragi" Immonen - My experiences on Defender External Attack Surface Management

* This presentation looked at two different vulnerability scanners, the Defender External Attack Surface Management (EASM) and an open source tool OWASP-AMASS
* The idea behind EASM is that it gives an external view of the infrastructure and performs continuous discovery of the digital attack surface
  * Reconnaissance, Scanning and Enumeration parts of vulnerability discovery
  * While it is a Microsoft product, it works on non-Microsoft services as well
  * Meant for CISO/CSO/CIO to find brand/infrastructure exposure risks, can also be used for rudimentary pentesting, threat hunting and vulnerability management
* Running discovery takes minutes to hours, has prebuilt dashboards with no customization possibility and insights
* Not completely polished, speaker told a funny story about how when trying to share a link to a colleague the tool generated a link that was 358000 characters long (obviously didn't work)
* Specific functionality includes (according to the speaker)
  * DNS queries
  * Certificate transparency queries (cert.sh)
  * Bot crawling (DOM analysis)
  * Port scanning
  * Queries to Shodan or similar database for history
  * Integrated to threat intelligence system
* Release at the same time as XDR suites
* Billing was not very transparent and quite confusing, even the word lottery was used, but there is a free trial for evaluation and the costs can be split by business unit/workspace if needed
* Copilot AI queries using a natural language were prohibitively expensive, though speaker thought it was an interesting idea.
* The speaker compared EASM with the open-source OWASP Amass tool
  * EASM was easy to start to use, AMASS setup took hours and a lot of effort
  * Scan times were comparable between both
  * Both gave results while scanning
  * EASM had excellent usability, while AMASS has very bad and outdated documentation.
  * Both allowed seeing changes over time, though AMASS needs some configuring for a persistence layer.
  * EASM is proprietary and has an SDK with some scripting possible, while AMASS is great for scripting and source code is available.
 
Even though the second presentation was most interesting, this one was most entertaining. The subject matter was also interesting, as my organization lives in the Microsoft ecosystem, and EASM might be something to try, though the random billing will probably mean that it won't be adopted. Some other tools have already been used to do external vulnerability scanning for my organization, though I'm not sure which since it is not my area of responsibility.
It was also not really a surprise to see the relatively well-polished proprietary solution that is easy to start using, versus the more flexible but not so user-friendly open source version.
