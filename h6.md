### Dingledine, Mathewson and Syverson 2004: Tor: The second-generation onion router. (https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2022/readings/tor-design.pdf)
The following is a summary for chapter 3

* The Tor network has four different design goals: Deployability, Usability, Flexibility and Simple design
* Deployability means the ability to easily and cheaply deploy the solution in the real world and not putting liability burdens on people who choose to deploy it.
* Usability means ease of use, and this is a key component because a hard-to-use system has fewer users, making it easier to identify a single user. As such it should be as plug and play as possible.
* Flexibility means just that, the system must be flexible enough to adapt to many uses to facilitate further research and discovery.
* Simple design means that the underlying protocols and security must be well-documented and relatively easy to understand as complexity adds cost and makes security analysis harder.
* The network also has non-goals, which include not peer-to-peer (does not need to be purely peer-to-peer, can have more persistent server-type peers), not secure against end-to-end attacks (preventing timing or intersection attacks), no protocol normalization (not removing potentially identifying information in the underlying protocols used to communicate with like HTTP), and it does not try to conceal who is connected to the network.
* The threat model for Tor does not intend to protect against an all-knowing global threat actor, but rather the assumption is that threat actors can observe, modify or subvert only a limited number of the transmitted data or nodes.

The point about usability being important due to increasing the number of users and this making it harder to identify people is an important point. Otherwise the network can just be thought of as a VPN that protects the IP address of the user (in the most common case). Naturally it also provides for other things like hidden services. Having centralized directory servers, however, makes preventing access to the network by blocking them at least theoretically possible (similar to blocking DNS), but there are naturally always other ways to get a list of currently active nodes to connect to it (like inputting DNS addresses manually in a hosts file)

### Karunanayake, Ahmed, Malaney, Islam and Jha 2021: De-anonymisation attacks on tor: A survey. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/9739/9621320/09471821.pdf)
The following is a summary for the abstract and chapters I and II

* The paper reviews known deanonymization attacks against users and hidden services on the Tor network.
* Because the anonymity is available to non-criminals as well as criminals, law enforcement is also attempting to crack the anonymity it provides.
* The paper presents a new multi-level taxonomy for categorizing different deanonymization attacks and analyses additional attacks compared to previous papers. (the taxonomy is not within the scope of the assignment)
* Tor is overlaid on top of TCP and provides circuits between a client and the destination server. This circuit generally consists of three voluntary relays.
  * The client requires the Onion Proxy (also known as the Tor client) to connect to the directory servers to discover services.
  * Directory servers are a small set of trusted and known servers in the network that provide information about the network to users and work based on consensus.
  * Entry nodes and Guards are nodes that clients use to join the network and as such their IP is known. Compromising them was used for deanonymization attacks in the past, but this has been mitigated through the use of guard nodes. Any node can become a guard node after eight days in the network.
  * Exit nodes are the final hops of a circuit and know the destination server's IP and, if compromised, can see the information transmitted through it. After an exit node the Tor network does not provide any encryption or confidentiality and is up to the underlying protocol.
  * Hidden services are services that have their own .onion address with the goal to not advertise their actual IP address. By default if a .onion address is not used only the user's identity is protected, not the destination server's.
  * Introduction points are random nodes that a hidden service chooses to register itself on the network and advertises those introduction points and its public key on the Hidden Service Directories. The IP address of the Hidden service thus remains hidden.
  * Rendezvous points are nodes that a client chooses alongside an entry and middle node to connect to the introduction point. As the connection to the rendezvous point is also a circuit, neither the Rendezvous or introduction point can identify the client.
  * Bridges are Tor relays that are not publicly listed and are used to prevent blocking the network if all nodes and relays were publically known. Each client only knows of a few bridges.
* To create a Tor circuit, the Tor client must first contact a Directory server for a list of active relays, and selects the entry, middle and exit nodes from that list. After that the client connects to each node in turn, exchanging encryption keys. Once done, the circuit is established. Tor uses fixed-length cells of 512 bytes to make traffic analysis harder.
* To connect to a Hidden service, a client first requests the introduction points of a Hidden service from a Directory server, creates a circuit to a random node (Rendezvous point), and then sends a Rendezvous cookie to the introduction point with the rendezvous point. The introduction point forwards that to the Hidden service. The Hidden service then creates a circuit of its own to the rendezvous point, completing the connection between the client and hidden service and allowing them to communicate with identity protected for both.
* Figure 6 provides taxonomy for Tor attacks. The four main categories are Network disruption attacks, Censorship attacks, De-anonymization attacks and Generic attacks. De-anonymization attacks are further split into Side channel attacks, Entry and Exit router attacks, OP/OR/Router attacks and Hybrid attacks, with a passive and active attack type for each. 

The terminology was a bit of a mouthful to digest in one go, but in the end it is relatively simple, as the first paper suggested (simple design). The way the Hidden services advertise themselves and how a connection is made from both sides to a central point to anonymize both sides was fascinating to read and understand.

### Halonen, Ollikainen, Rajala 2023: PhishSticks - The Ethical Hackers tool for BadUSB - video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDzVevtZiWE&ab_channel=PhishSticks

* The video tells a fictional story of how an ignorant CEO loses their business to a security threat.
* A penetration tester leaves a malicious USB PhishStick on the CEO's desk, which has a keylogger installation payload in it.
* The CEO inserts the stick into a USB port and the device executes a oneliner that fetches the actual payload from the internet and runs it.
* The attack is visible on the screen only for a very short time.
* Once the keylogger is running, it captures all keystrokes, such as usernames and passwords.
* The data is sent via HTTP POST to the hacker, who receives the data and can then do whatever he wants with it.
* The video then provides a picture of the CEO having lost their job and warns of significant potential monetary losses or legal ramifications due to such attacks.

This was a quick and fun watch, I have also dabbled a bit with USB HID devices (used a device called  Rubber Ducky) and tested it when mass-installing computers so that instead of typing the default username and password and running an installation script I put those on the HID device and just plugged it in to save my fingers. This was a long time ago, nowadays everything is automated much better.

## a)

Decided to install the Tor client on my Windows computer instead of the VM, since everything is anonymous anyway.

* Went to the page, downloaded Tor browser for Windows, ran installer with defaults

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2af03615-8b1b-4904-b64b-bafda06b3952)

* Checked the "always connect automatically" slider and pressed connect.

* After a few seconds the top right icon changed to connected

## b) 

Quick googling provided e.g. https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/best-onion-sites-on-dark-web/ with a list of various darknet search engines.

Chose juhanurmihxlp77nkq76byazcldy2hlmovfu2epvl5ankdibsot4csyd.onion as the search engine to use

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef57e242-7df8-48a1-8043-76f43f32ce83)

Using that search engine search for "human rights"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd05788e-64f2-4c5b-9674-4ddba6806058)

The first result is for Afghanistan, where Taliban is in control and this seems like a way for the people in the country to access information outside their control

Next searched for marketplace

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5d19bfa-fb58-4a3c-bb52-fb00f4454040)

Checked out the first link (Venus marketplace), a lot of the offerings seemed to center on drugs, but other stuff was also available. I'm wondering how one would actually receive something like guns anonymously, sounds like pretty risky business to me even if the transaction is anonymous, especially since scams also exist.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94602fee-0fbb-4acd-988b-5677a1588d74)

Next searched for fraud, checked out the first link

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68661118-dc92-4a3a-94b9-23bffba24f63)

The results seemed to contain scams as well as potentially information stolen through fraud (like crypto wallets etc). For public and non-anonymous blockchains it can be hard to launder the crypto (many large scam addresses that still contain the crypto are known and being kept an eye on), this seems like one way to get a fraction of it if some offerings are not scams. 

Next searched for forum, checked out the Darknet army link

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49662e2-c828-4ecd-875e-17b655ab11e3)

Seemed to contain some requests for illegal services, although many title seemed stale. As I am using a public search engine for Tor, these are likely all scams or morons, but fun to check out.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b684c494-0d3a-416b-861d-24dde2b3ab47)

Searched for Amnesty, since it does human rights stuff.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0664cea-fc84-42dc-b3ee-687ff384d7d0)

The top result opened a page full of ads, seemed like one of the many SEO adspam sites that are also present on the public Internet.

I would not trust any of the sites as far as I could throw them, if I really wanted darknet services it would need to be some kind of introduction to a site from a trusted third party.

## c)

Anonymity in Tor could be though of as a series of VPN connections. First you pick a node, connect to them and initiate encryption using their public key, exchange sessions keys and establish a tunnel. Once that is done you connect to the next node through that tunnel using that node's public key and repeat. None of the nodes can know whether you're the actual client or are just forwarding some other client's stuff like they are, and only the last node (exit node) can read the underlying data you're sending as they forward it to the destination server. The paper mentioned that exchanging secrets with the nodes are done using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.

## d) 

Tor deals with anonymity, so some threat models could be hostile/censorship prone governments or organizations, or attempts to inspect/fingerprint traffic to find out where traffic is coming from (or going to in the case of Tor services). Basically any threat model where remaining anonymous is critical would be an appropriate use for Tor. It would not fit threats against the integrity or privacy of the data, as the path from the exit node to the destination server is outside the network so responsibility for that is on the underlying protocol.

## e) 

The attack works by the stick showing to the computer as a USB HID device (keyboard) and then upon insertion and possibly a small delay the stick sends keypresses to either open a reverse shell immediately, or to download a payload that is then executed on the background. Basically anything you can do on a keyboard you can type from the stick.

A typical organization would be vulnerable, as I believe not many malware scanners or antivirus software would catch the command as it was being run, as the executable is trusted (usually powershell.exe etc). Some might scan the parameters and get triggered, but I doubt that would be common. Firewalls would also not block the connection, as outbound tcp/443 is rarely blocked.

The risk could be mitigated in various ways, the first is naturally telling users not to stick unknown mass storage devices in the computers and to not leave their computer unattended unlocked. Another a bit more arcane way could be to block the generic USB HID devices and only allowing device IDs of a trusted keyboard vendor, though an APT could get by that by having their mass storage device mimic those device IDs. Another way is an aggressive malware scanner that includes scanning command parameters and aggressive heuristics, or banning Powershell altogether or having it run in limited mode. Last would be some kind of firewall monitoring capability, that might not be able to block it outright but could help with detection. Windows Firewall could also be used to block outbound internet connections from powershell.exe and other shells, for example, except to trusted destinations (e.g. Microsoft's update servers).
