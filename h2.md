* In section 2.5 the book first goes through how public key cryptography was invented, and then how the example characters Alice and Bob would go through first exchanging public keys and then encrypting their messages using the other's public key, which the receiving party then decrypts using their private key
* In the same section the book describes so-called hybrid cryptosystems, where both asymmetric (public key) and symmetric encryption are used during various parts of the communication/encryption process. The reasons for this are both the relative slowness of asymmetric cryptography to symmetric cryptography, but also the potential for chosen-plaintext attacks, which public key crypto is vulnerable to. As such, in practical applications asymmetric cryptography is used to establish an initial secure tunnel, through which a symmetric key (so-called session key) can be exchanged securely and then used for more persistent data transfer without the downsides of asymmetric crypto
* Merkle's puzzles are also described, which according to the book were the first construction of public-key cryptography. The idea is that the puzzles are easier to solve for the sender and recipient than a potential eavesdropper
* Section 2.6 goes through digital signatures. Properties of digital signatures are (to a reasonable certainty) authenticity, unforgeability, single-use (signature cannot be moved to another document), unalterability (document cannot be altered once signed) and non-repudiation (confirms that the signer signed it).
* The book then provides examples of a digital signature using symmetric keys and an arbitrator, where the parties trust the arbitrator, and so whenever they want to create a digital signature they send the document to the arbitrator, and the same if they want to confirm the digital signature.
* Following that, the book goes through the evolution of modern digital signatures by using the signer's private key to sign a timestamped hash of the message instead of the entire message and how to add multiple signatures where necessary. It also explains how the nonrepudiation part can be gamed by signing a signature, then later leaking their private key and claiming some other party used it to sign the document. This can be alleviated with timestamping.
* Section 2.7 goes through sending encrypted messages with digital signatures, and why both should be used to guarantee integrity and authenticity. It also goes through the pitfall of a resend attack in case received messages are too naively decrypted and the reply encrypted without safeguards such as checking the attached digital signature or using different algorithms for the digital signature and encrypting the actual message. It also emphasizes the importance of verifying that a public key actually belongs to the actual party and that it should not be assumed without verification.
* Section 2.8 describes random and pseudo-random sequence generation. It emphasizes that computers are always deterministic and cannot produce random output on their own. It also describes some properties of randomness that one needs to expect from a pseudorandom sequence, and goes slightly into the philosophy of randomness. It also separates pseudorandom sequences from cryptographically secure pseudorandom sequences.

Most of the sections are previously familiar to me, but I haven't had the need to look into Markle puzzles and the history of asymmetric crypto, so that was new information to me. The two various attacks were also good refreshers, but are not really relevant as long as one uses proper practices in designing and using various systems. Pseudorandomness and its predictability is interesting even though it is also not new information, since I have looked at various tool-assisted speedruns of games, and the things one can do to a naive pseudorandom algorithm by controlling its inputs are fascinating. One example of this is a Chrono Trigger RNG manipulation run.

The text goes in detail through how Bitcoin transactions work from the person's as well as the cryptographic perspective

* First the text makes an analogy between an excel spreadsheet with sequential rows and the transactions on the blockchain
* Then the text equates mining rewards with a salary and goes through the bitcoin money supply curve, the maximum of which is at below 21 million bitcoins
* Then the text explains the difference between bits, bytes and hex representation and hashes and several hashing functions as well as how they are used in bitcoin.
* After that the text explains digital signatures and public key cryptography and they are used to sign and verify payments (transactions) in the blockchain
* Then the text emphasizes how important it is to both keep your private keys secure as well as backed up and goes through several ways of doing that (online vs offline, cleartext vs encrypted etc).

All of this is familiar to me, as I have over 10 years of experience in crypto, especially in Bitcoin. It was good to read through it as a refresher, since everything is not in active memory.

## 3) Source: https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/

* The article describes how to utilize gpg to encrypt and sign messages.
* First the article describes how to generate keypairs to use in encryption and how to export the public key from the keypair.
* Then the article goes through how to test the functionality using two different hypothetical users in two different working directories by first sharing and confirming eachother's public key to establish trust, and then using their public keys to encrypt and sign a message that the recipient can then decrypt and verify using their private key.

Even though I do not use Linux and thus gpg in my daily life, it is a good tutorial on how to set up and test gpg.


## a) 

* Most applications deal with work things apart from using HTTPS, where the identity of the server/webpage is verified by a trusted root certificate authority having signed their certificate, and the public key of the certificate (and the private key on the server side) is used to open a secure communications channel.
* One common work application is logon using a smart card to prove one's identity. Effectively a certificate is issued to the owner of the smart card, and the private key with the certificate is then stored on the smart card. In a Windows environment both Active Directory and the computer must trust the issuing certificate authority, after which by providing the public part of the issued certificate and signing it with the private key, your identity can be confirmed to the domain controller (you have the private key to the certificate and thus own the identity claimed in the certificate) (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/certificates-and-public-key-infrastructure-pki/enabling-smart-card-logon-third-party-certification-authorities)
* Laptops at work authenticate to the wireless controller using machine certificates, which is effectively similar to smart card logon (connect to wireless controller with signed certificate, forwarded to RADIUS server which then checks its validity and identity, and either sends back a message that allows or disallows connection). 
* Generally the applications I encounter utilize asymmetric encryption just to establish tunnels or to validate identities or integrity, less so with directly encrypting messages. 
* Beyond that most authentication/encryption in a Windows domain ecosystem is Kerberos or other symmetric key cryptography (e.g. Bitlocker).

The following generates a private key using openssl, and then a corresponding public key. For this exercise only one keypair is used, but like in b) one could generate two keypairs to simulate two parties. Notably this only encrypts the file, it doesn't digitally sign it and so the sender cannot be verified with these options.

    openssl genpkey --algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -aes256
    openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

## d) 

* Eve as a passive eavesdropper has access to both parties' public keys as well as the encrypted messages. Eve could create forged encrypted messages otherwise, but since gpg includes a digital signature of the sender with the encrypted file, this attack does not work. This has required that both parties have added trust to the others' public key using the --sign-key parameter and by adding signature with the --sign parameter alongside --encrypt parameter when encrypting the message.
* Mallory cannot maliciously modify the messages, as they are encrypted using the --encrypt and --sign parameters and he does not have the private key of either party, so the digital signature would not match when using the --decrypt parameter and/or the output would become gibberish for the receiving party.

 ## f) 

 * When using a password manager, one first creates a key vault and sets a strong master password/passphrase for it (tens of characters). A certificate or an extra keyfile can also be used.
 * Once set, the password manager can be used to store all passwords and other secrets behind the master password.
 * Password managers can have security features such as when copying the password the clipboard is emptied after a certain time, or password can be directly input into a password field without having to even copy it.
 * The primary benefit of a password manager is that one only needs one very strong secret, and completely unique passwords can be used for all services.
 * This protects against risks with password reuse, since if a malicious party can intercept the password of a service then only that service gets compromised, whereas if the password is reused, multiple services can get compromised.
 * A password manager can also be used to generate a strong and random password, which avoids pitfalls such as using a pet's name or birthday which are easier to guess. With a password manager only the master password must be remembered.

## g) Done.
