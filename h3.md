### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography, subchapters 2.3 and 2.4 (https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)

* Subchapter 2.3 explains the idea behind a one-way function, where the value of a function is easy to compute, but it is much harder to reverse, that is, compute the original value from the result.
* It provides an analogy in the form of smashing a plate - easy to smash, hard to put back together.
* The subchapter also mentions that there is no proof that real one-way functions exist, even if some look to be that way.
* As a special case the subchapter mentions trapdoor one-way functions, where reversing the one-way function is possible if one knows the secret associated with it.
* Subchapter 2.4 expand the idea to one-way hash functions and mentions their importance to modern cryptography.
* One-way hash functions take a variable length input (pre-image) and convert it to a fixed-length output (hash value). This can be thought of as fingerprinting the input.
* Good one-way hash functions are collision-free, which means it is hard to find two pre-images with the same hash output. Additionally, hash functions are public and do not rely on secrecy to be effective.
* Message authentication codes are one-way hash functions that also include a secret key, where the idea is that only someone who has the key can verify the fingerprint of the input.

The subchapters ease one into thinking about hashes and what they are, but the trapdoor one-way functions already try to hint at what asymmetric key cryptography is, as they function exactly as described (reversible with secret).

### Karvinen 2022: Cracking passwords with hashcat (https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)

The tutorial goes through how one installs hashcat, its dependencies and how one uses it to crack hashes. The steps are approximately the following:

* Install hashcat
* Download a dictionary to use for dictionary-based attacks
* Identify the hash type using hashcat's -m parameter and/or other deduction on where the hash came from
* Using the correct command-line parameters, attempt to crack the hash

The instructions are very straightforward, I have not had to use hashcat before but I have known about it and how it works.

## a)

    echo -n "hello"|sha256sum'

    echo -n "hello aa"|sha256sum

What do you have to add to get a hash that begins with a zero?
    echo -n "hello28"|sha256sum

Voluntary bonuses:
* To get a valid block you need to find a hash that is lower than the current target hash of the Bitcoin network. This basically means that you need to have fewer frontal zeroes in your calculated hash than in the target hash.
* For every extra zero in the hash representation, the difficulty raises by a factor of 16 (every hex-represented character has 16 possibilities, and basic probability for consecutive results is to multiply the chance for each so 6 zeroes = (1/16)^6 which is about 1 in 16,8 million.
* I am less familiar with bash scripting, but the following attempts 100000 hashes in Powershell and prints the first hash found for every extra zero.:
```powershell
    $zeroes = 0
    for ($i = 0;$i -lt 100000;$i++) {
        $s = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new()
        $sw = [System.IO.StreamWriter]::new($s)
        $str = "asdf$i"
        $sw.write($str)
        $sw.flush()
        $s.position = 0
        $a = (Get-FileHash -InputStream $s).hash
        if ($a -match "^(0{$zeroes,})") {
            $numzeroes = $matches[1].length
            if ($numzeroes -gt $zeroes) {
                write-host "$($str): $a"
                $zeroes = $numzeroes
            }
        }
    }
```

The hashes are completely different

Tried out the --help command to make sure it installed, screenshot is of the very end of the output

The cracked password is admin, and it was an MD5 hash (currently considered vulnerable and not suited for cryptographic applications).

### e)

To make a password that's protected against a dictionary attack requires that there is sufficient entropy to prevent bruteforcing. There are many ways to do this:

* In my view the best way is to have a long and completely random password. These are hard to memorize, and it is really feasible only with the help of password managers.
* The second best way is to have it be sufficiently long phrase of nonsense that you can easily remember with potentially some special characters and non-words sprinkled in (e.g. "I like computers but HATE computing water zenga").
* A shorter random password would be easier to remember and would still foil dictionary attacks, but leave the password vulnerable to brute-forcing (if nothing else there are probably rainbow tables for over 10-character random passwords now if one does not use salt)

### f) 
Before even running the command the hash looked like something you'd find in /etc/shadow

    hashcat '$2y$18$axMtQ4N8j/NQVItQJed9uORfsUK667RAWfycwFMtDBD6zAo1Se2eu'
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c1cf3e2-b4a7-48da-ad2d-77f202803c99)

Chose 3200 as the potential hash type

    hashcat -m 3200 '$2y$18$axMtQ4N8j/NQVItQJed9uORfsUK667RAWfycwFMtDBD6zAo1Se2eu' rockyou.txt -o f.txt

    cat f.txt

The hash rate is extremely slow, as the bcrypt hash has a high cost factor ($18). This means more computing for every single hash, in this case it took 1Â½ minutes to calculate 4 hashes. This can be a benefit to make bruteforcing hashes harder, but choosing too high values for something like a webpage or another interactive logon, for example, can make the service more susceptible to Denial of Service-attacks by making it possible to exhaust available CPU power. In this case, if my computer was running a webpage and someone tried logging on, it would cause a delay of up to half a minute while the password was being hashed.
