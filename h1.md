## Summaries

### Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains

* The paper URL is at https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf
* The paper draws parallels between earlier work on military and intelligence kill chains and adapts them to the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) paradigm
* APTs distinguish themselves from earlier "dumb" cyber threats such as generic viruses and malware by being adaptive and human-guided, targeting and probing specific weaknesses in the target environment and adapting based on failures
* As such, the paper specifies a "kill chain" or a model of specific phases which all must succeed for the intrusion to be successful. Building the defensive posture to target multiple phases allows for a defence in depth, where even if the attacker manages to successfully penetrate and implement the earlier phases of the kill chain, the overall attack will fail if even one phase fails.
* The phases of a cyber kill chain in the paper are Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation and Command & Control (C2)
* Detecting and thwarting an attack allows the defender to adapt their security posture to better detect and prevent further attacks from the same attacker, as repeated attacks from the same attacker often recycle some parts of the previous attack due to resource constraints (in the paper examples include reusing the same exploit, filenames and encryption algorithms, and utilizing comparable social engineering techniques as well as the same C2 endpoint)

Having been interested in nuclear energy and aviation disasters and their root causes, the concept of "defence in depth", or multiple things needing to go wrong in order for a disaster to happen is already familiar to me. Effectively the kill chain is another variation of this principle, and having the different phases clearly spelled out helps one to analyse the environment for potential vulnerabilities and target limited resources to best spread the defence posture to multiple phases.

### Darknet diaries, EP 135: The D.R. Incident 

* The transcript URL is https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/135/
* The story deals with a situation where a ransomware group called Conti had persistently attacked multiple government agencies in Costa Rica
* The engineer in the story, Omar, started looking at a neighboring government's (Dominican Republic) systems to see if they, too had been compromised in some way and found malware on a webserver. He found the the malware due to the unrelated defacement of the webpage by someone else. It was also discovered that they had managed to exploit another vulnerability that allowed them VPN access to the network
* Due to detecting the intrusion relatively quickly and reacting to it correctly, the C2 channel was interrupted before the attack could be finished
* Some time later they implemented a tool that allowed for DNS monitoring - this also allowed them to detect that a system was still compromised and was communicating with a known C2 server and it was being used to download hacking tools.
* Again, the attack was thwarted by cleaning the system and removing the hacking tools. Due to being a confirmed target they took steps to alert the users of the government's agencies.
* This resulted in the security team receiving hundreds of different potential phishing e-mails forwarded from the users, which they analysed and found out what malware and phishing methods were being used.
* They then realized that the attacker had actually previously compromised another company that the government had legitimate business with, and used that relationship to get the users on the government's side to open malicious attachments from that company believing them to be legitimate.
* Due to the scale of the threat they requested more information from both the Costa Rican government and also other contacts and security vendors.
* They realized that the threat actor had been active on their systems for almost a year and in addition to several hacker groups potentially also included a governmental actor, Russia. Once they realized both them and Costa Rica had been targeted, they started sharing information and indicators regionally with other governments as well.
* Once all of this was figured out and the infection vectors and the malware deconstructed, steps for remediation and prevention were shared among all relevant parties. Ultimately it seems the no data got exfiltrated and the ransomware was not triggered in the Dominican Republic's systems prior to the environment being ultimately cleaned.

The story is interesting, and in my earlier workplace the I worked as an IT support it was a policy that if a user encountered an at-all suspicious e-mail, they would ask IT about it with very low threshold. Surprisingly often the mail ended up being legitimate, but the policy also helped to catch several malicious ones. Additionally it was important to never berate the user but rather affirm their decision to ask the IT about the e-mails, even if they ended up being legitimate. It was surprising to read that a governmental actor would not have that kind of policy or some analogous monitoring in place. Reading about the compromise of a legitimate company to facilitate delivery of malware also reminds me of a relatively recent supply chain attack (CVE-2024-3094), where one OpenSSH dependency (or library of a dependency) was taken over and could have potentially provided backdoors to several Linux distributions and millions of computers.

### Explain "tactic", "technique" and "procedure" in context of ATT&CK, and give an example of each.

* MITRE ATT&CK FAQ is at https://attack.mitre.org/resources/faq/
* ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix is at https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/
* Tactic refers to the overall reason that the attacker is trying to perform an action (technique), and answers the question "why". In the ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix examples of tactics are e.g. Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Defence Evasion and Lateral Movement
* A technique and a sub-technique refers to a way an attacker could achieve the goals of a tactic. Examples include Active Scanning for the tactic Reconnaissance, Phishing and Supply Chain Compromise for the tactic Initial Access, Access Token Manipulation and Direct Volume Access for Defense Evasion and Exploitation of Remote Services for Lateral Movement
* A procedure is the specific implementation of a technique. For Active Scanning it could be a port scan to find open ports and services, for Phishing it could include crafting a legitimate-looking e-mail and linking it to a malicious website, and for Exploitation of Remote Services it could include using file shares to distribute malicious payloads across the network using shared credentials.

The matrix is relatively straightforward and the abstraction layers seem useful to group similar concepts into one. Even though a kill chain is not dependent on all tactics, a good cybersecurity posture should at the very least consider each of them and whether or not the various techniques should be (further) mitigated in the environment. 

## Assignments

### a) 

* Cyber kill chain: https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf
* ATT&CK Enterprise matrix: https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/

The Cyber Kill Chain describes a mindset on how to think about modern persistent and targeted threats. It does not describe specific steps to take to mitigate threats, except for a few included examples, but rather provides an overall framework. The ATT&CK Enterprise matrix, on the other hand, provides specific and practical information about how each phase of a kill chain might be achieved, and thus give targets for defensive measures.

I believe it could be compared to ISO27001 and ISO27002, specifically where ISO27001 gives an overall description of the framework and requirements and is analogous to the Cyber kill chain, whereas ISO27002 describes specific controls on how to achieve the technical goals defined in ISO27001 and would be analogous to the ATT&CK Enterprise matrix.

### b) 

* The security incident is CVE-2024-3094 (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094)
* Writeup of the history is from https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor

The incident is an interesting one, and it caught my eye because it was only caught due to a person noticing unusual delays (0.5s) when logging in to SSH with the malicious version installed (original report at https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4). If the exploit had not been noticed and had gone live, the attacker controlling the private key could have potentially accessed any OpenSSH installation which had a dependency to the compromised repository. The attack also took years to prepare and included quite a lot of technical knowledge as well as social engineering that allowed a sufficient takeover of the repository.

The threat actor in this case was the character known as JiaT75 (Jia Tan), which is likely an alias. The exploit is social engineering that ultimately allowed the malicious code to be inserted into the xz library. The vulnerability could be seen as being OpenSSH's trust in the dependency chain and their maintenance procedures, as the malicious code was (almost) allowed to be included in various Linux distributions and was in fact present in the repository. The business impact could have been immense, since not only would the exploit have allowed remote access to any system which had included the vulnerable version of OpenSSH and the xz dependency, but since OpenSSH's daemon needs root access, the exploiter of the remote access could've potentially had root access to the server itself, and from there laterally spread to other systems, as they likely would've also had the vulnerable OpenSSH version installed. This could have allowed sensitive data exfiltration, blackmail or potentially even direct access to the financial systems of businesses. The potential impact is about the worst that I could think of.

### c)

* The instructions referred to below are at https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/
* Downloading image there were no issues
* VirtualBox required Visual C++ Redistributable 2019, had to download that from Microsoft's page
* Did not include VirtualBox Python Bindings in VirtualBox install, since those also had some kind of dependency on something else and they seemed unnecessary
* Booted to live environment ok based on instructions, went with 8 GiB memory, 2 CPUs and 80 GB HDD for the VM
* Noticed that Win+R also works to bring up a window similar to Windows run prompt/start menu in Debian
* LiveDVD's Installer worked fine according to instructions, surprising that it noticed the laptop was on battery and warned about it since it's a VM (in hindsight it is obvious)
* After installation there were no issues and everything proceeded according to the instructions when booting to the installed OS desktop
* Installed VirtualBox Guest Additions, opened terminal to the CD by right-clicking and "Open terminal here" and ran the installer that way instead of using path with wildcards
* After reboot changed display resolution to 1920x1080 via right-click -> Applications -> Settings -> Display
* Also changed VirtualBox Virtual Screen 1 to 1920x1080, no annoying border and everything is fine
* Got annoyed approximately 50 times during the process, because the VM window naturally eats Alt+Tab if it has focus. Found out at the end that this can be disabled by disabling the "Auto capture keyboard" option in VirtualBox and that capture can be toggled using the right CTRL key by default
* Host system is a Windows 11 home laptop, Asus Zenbook, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB disk, CPU AMD Ryzen 5 7530U with Radeon Graphics 2.00 GHz. Host display resolution is 2560x1600.
